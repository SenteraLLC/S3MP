## General Instructions
- Keep it simple.
- Work in small, incremental changes.
- Do not add new dependencies unless given explicit permission.

## Task Tracking
- Always start each step by referencing and updating your tasks in `.github/tasks.md`.
- Use checkboxes to track progress.
- Work on one task at a time.
- Do not mark tasks as complete until they are fully done. Ask for confirmation if unsure.

## Repository Style
- Follow existing code style and conventions.
- Use `snake_case` for variable and function names.
- Use `PascalCase` for class names.
- Avoid using `Any` type hints if possible; be specific. Get permission from the user before using `Any`.
